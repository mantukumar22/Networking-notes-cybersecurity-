# Chapter 1 — Why We Should Learn Network & Networking?
### (Cybersecurity / Ethical Hacking Perspective)

## 1. Why Networking Is the Foundation of Cybersecurity

Every cyberattack, defense, and forensic investigation happens **on a network**. You cannot secure, exploit, or investigate what you don't understand structurally. This is why every certification (CEH, Security+, OSCP, CCNA, CySA+) starts with networking fundamentals.

> **Core idea:** Hacking is nothing but *making a computer/system do something it wasn't supposed to do — over a network.* If you don't understand how data moves, you can't understand how it's intercepted, manipulated, or stolen.

## 2. Key Reasons an Ethical Hacker Must Learn Networking

### a) Attack Surface Understanding
- Every open port, protocol, and service is a potential entry point.
- You can't scan (Nmap), enumerate, or exploit a target if you don't know what IPs, ports, protocols, and services mean.

### b) Traffic Analysis & Packet Sniffing
- Tools like **Wireshark, tcpdump** require knowledge of packets, headers, IP/TCP/UDP structure.
- Detecting anomalies (e.g., unusual traffic spikes, data exfiltration) needs baseline network knowledge.

### c) Understanding Attacks Themselves
Most attacks are **networking concepts abused**:
| Attack | Networking Concept Abused |
|---|---|
| Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) | ARP, routing, switching |
| DNS Spoofing/Poisoning | DNS protocol |
| Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) | TCP handshake, bandwidth/protocol flooding |
| Session Hijacking | TCP sequence numbers, cookies |
| Port Scanning | TCP/UDP port behavior |
| VLAN Hopping | Switching, trunking (802.1Q) |
| Rogue Access Points | Wireless networking |

### d) Building & Securing Infrastructure
- Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs, proxies — all require networking knowledge to configure and bypass/test.
- Network segmentation (VLANs, subnetting) is a primary defense strategy pentesters must understand to move laterally (or stop lateral movement).

### e) Real-World Job Requirement
- SOC Analyst, Penetration Tester, Network Security Engineer, Red/Blue Team — **all job descriptions list networking as a mandatory skill**, usually before "hacking tools."

## 3. What This Course Will Build Toward (Roadmap Context)

This chapter sets the stage for the rest of the syllabus, each of which maps to a security skill:

| Later Chapter | Security Relevance |
|---|---|
| Networking Terminology | Common language used in threat reports, CVEs, pentest reports |
| Networking Devices | Knowing what a router/switch/firewall does = knowing how to attack/defend it |
| OSI & TCP/IP Model | **The most important theoretical foundation** — every attack is mapped to an OSI layer |
| Transmission Media | Physical security, wiretapping risks |
| IP Addressing | Subnetting for scoping pentests, understanding NAT bypass, IP spoofing |
| Wireless Technology | WiFi hacking (WPA2 cracking, evil twin attacks) |
| Networking Protocols | Protocol-specific exploits (SMB, FTP, Telnet, HTTP, etc.) |
| Network Vulnerability & Securing | Direct pentesting/hardening skill |
| IoT | Growing attack surface — most insecure devices |

## 4. Key Takeaway for a Cybersecurity Learner

> "You cannot hack, defend, or investigate a network you do not understand. Networking is not a prerequisite chapter to rush through — it is 60–70% of practical ethical hacking skill."

**Action point:** Treat every future chapter as "how can this be attacked?" and "how can this be defended?" — this dual mindset is what separates a script-kiddie from an actual security professional.

## Quick Revision Points
- Networking = backbone of all cyberattacks and defenses.
- Every major attack category maps to a networking concept.
- Tools (Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite) all assume networking literacy.
- Job roles in cybersecurity list networking as a core, non-negotiable skill.
- This chapter is conceptual — the "why" — before the technical "how" begins in Chapter 2 onward.
